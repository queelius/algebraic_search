    ## Formal Theory: Boolean Algebra Over Query Results

    The evaluation results of a query can be represented as a Boolean algebra,
    where the query results are elements of the algebra. Using conventional
    notation, the algebra is defined as follows:

        (R=P([0, 1]^n), and=&, or=|, not=~, bottom=0, top=1)

    - `R = [r_1, r_2, ..., r_n]` where each `r_i` âˆˆ [0, 1] represents the
      degree-of-membership of the i-th document in the query result.
    - `&` is the element-wise minimum.
    - `|` is the element-wise maximum.
    - `~` is the element-wise complement (`1 - r_i`).

    These operations form a Boolean algebra when results are binary (0 or 1)
    and a fuzzy Boolean algebra when results are in the continuous range [0, 1].

    ## Homomorphism between queries (like BooleanQuery) and ResultQuery

    The evaluation function `eval` in, for instance, the `BooleanQuery` class
    serves as a homomorphism `eval: Q -> R` that preserves the algebraic
    structure:
    
    - `eval(Q1 & Q2) = eval(Q1) & eval(Q2)`
    - `eval(Q1 | Q2) = eval(Q1) | eval(Q2)`
    - `eval(~Q1) = ~eval(Q1)`

    This ensures that the logical composition of queries translates
    appropriately to the combination of their evaluation results.

    ## Fuzzy Operations

    We also provide a range of built-in fuzzy operations that can be applied
    to the evaluation results of a query:

    - `very`: Squares the degree-of-membership of each document.
    - `somewhat`: Takes the square root of the degree-of-membership of each document.
    - `slightly`: Takes the 10th root of the degree-of-membership of each document.
    - `extremely`: Cubes the degree-of-membership of each document.
    - `binary`: Maps the degree-of-membership of each document to 0 if it is less
        than 0.5, and 1 otherwise.
    - `true`: Maps the degree-of-membership of each document to 1.
    - `false`: Maps the degree-of-membership of each document to 0.
    - `map`: Maps the degree-of-membership of each document to 0 if it is less than
      a specified threshold, and 1 otherwise.

    Of course, you are free to define your own fuzzy operations as needed.
